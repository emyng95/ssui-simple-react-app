        "Growing up, I remember learning that Taipei 101 was the tallest building in the world, though this, of course, changed with the construction of Burj Khalifa in 2010.",
        "I remember the construction started when I was little and was built by 2004. The first time I visited the building was with my dad on his now retired scooter. I remember looking up at the tower as my dad drove up close to the building. A sense of overwhelming feeling immediately took over. From a distance, it was hard to grasp how tall the building was until I was right below it.  It towered over the cityscape like nothing I had ever seen.",
        "The view from the observation deck is even more stunning. The sky that night happened to be super clear and it was breathtaking looking out the deck. I spent a great time with my dad and my brother observing the changes that were taking place in the city over that night. I definitely recommend that you visit Taipei 101 when you are in Taiwan!"

        "40 minutes by car from downtown Taipei, you’ll reach the vintage town of Jiufen. Today, it’s filled with tourists, but during the Qing Dynasty, only nine families lived here. Hence part of its name “Jiufen,” meaning “nine portions” in Mandarin. ",
        "I remember visiting here when I was little with my parents during long weekends so we could stay until later of the night to see the lattern lit up. These memories are still so vivid. Me and my brother would race one another to see who can get to the top of the stairs the soonest. Of course, I always lost but thinking back those where great memories.",

The best place to view the sunrise is on the top of Zhu Hill. The place and time of the sunrise are different due to the changes of the four seasons.",
        "If you plan to view the sunrise it is best to ask the local people the time of sunrise, so you don't miss this magnificent opportunity. When the sun is rising slowly from the peak, it sends out the golden rays for a short time which provides a spectacular scene."
