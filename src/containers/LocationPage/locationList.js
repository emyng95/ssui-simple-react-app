        "Growing up, I remember learning that Taipei 101 was the tallest building in the world, though this, of course, changed with the construction of Burj Khalifa in 2010.",
        "I remember the construction started when I was little and was built by 2004. The first time I visited the building was with my dad on his now retired scooter. I remember looking up at the tower as my dad drove up close to the building. A sense of overwhelming feeling immediately took over. From a distance, it was hard to grasp how tall the building was until I was right below it.  It towered over the cityscape like nothing I had ever seen.",
        "The view from the observation deck is even more stunning. The sky that night happened to be super clear and it was breathtaking looking out the deck. I spent a great time with my dad and my brother observing the changes that were taking place in the city over that night. I definitely recommend that you visit Taipei 101 when you are in Taiwan!"

        "Taipei 101’s 101 floors symbolize the renewal of time and pushing the limits of perfection."

    fact3: [
        "The tower can withstand tough forces of nature. Taipei 101 was built to face the harshest typhoons and earthquakes."

    who: [
      "A gleaming golden God to some, a deeply annoying buzz-kill to others, protocol droid Threepio is fluent in over 6,000,000 forms of communication, and boy does he love to go on about it."
    ],
    why: [
      "If Threepio had restricted himself to the original ‘Star Wars’ trilogy he’d be higher on this list: his appearances in those movies, whether it’s berating R2-D2 for his obstinacy, tapping Han Solo on the shoulder mid-snog or awkwardly buddying up to Jabba the Hutt, are consistently charming and funny. But the prequel trilogy tended to use him as an automatic gag generator, punctuating the action with inappropriate asides (‘this is such a drag!’). Also, how did a slave boy on a remote desert world manage to build a droid that knows 6,000,000 languages? Anyway, let’s hope the new movies restore our cybernetic hero to his former glory."
